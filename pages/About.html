            <p>
                Hello! I'm <strong>Musiimenta Agnes Angel</strong>, a passionate and dedicated web developer with 2 years of experience in crafting dynamic and responsive websites.
                I specialize in creating seamless user experiences and beautiful front-end designs. I have honed my skills through continuous learning and real-world projects.

            <p>
                I graduated from the <strong>Women's Institute of Technology and Innovation</strong>, where I developed a deep understanding of web development, design, and the technologies that power the modern web.
                I am always excited to take on new challenges and bring creative ideas to life on the web.
            </p>

                My primary skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, but I'm constantly expanding my knowledge to stay at the forefront of web technologies.
